# Visualization of Sorting Algorithm

Creating a visualization of sorting algorithms using React.JS and D3.JS. 

## Usage

Bring up command line for example git bash to run the webpage type within the file 'npm start' this will launch localhost.

Then you have two buttons a new data button which will provide you with a new array and a bubble sort which will sort the present array.


## Future possibiliies 

In the future I would like to add more sorting algorithms as well slow down the animations by taking note of each step to display in a slower motion.
